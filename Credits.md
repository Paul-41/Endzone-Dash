# 🏆 Credits

This project draws creative inspiration from the action-packed world of football and the fast-paced arcade style of Crossy Road.

## 🏈 Football Influence

The core gameplay mechanics are inspired by key elements of American football, especially:

- **Running the ball** through the field
- **Avoiding tackles** from defenders
- **Getting tackled** as part of the risk-reward gameplay
- **Scoring touchdowns** as the ultimate goal

These ideas shape the player’s objective and the high-pressure, decision-making experience at the heart of the game.

## 🕹️ Crossy Road Inspiration

The journey to the field takes direct influence from **[Crossy Road](https://www.hipsterwhale.com/crossy-road/)** by Hipster Whale. Specifically, we were inspired by:

- **Navigating chaotic environments** filled with dynamic, timing-based obstacles
- **Top-down lane-based movement**
- **Quick, reflex-driven decisions**

This style is used to simulate the challenge of **getting to the football game** through traffic, hazards, and mayhem — all in a stylized, playful way.
