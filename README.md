## 🎮 Game Overview

In **Endzone Dash**, you're a football player who **oversleeps on game day**. Now, it's a race against the clock to make it to the field and score the game-winning touchdown.

The game plays out in three dynamic stages:

1. **Wake-Up Call**  
   Start in your bedroom where you wake up late—get moving quickly or you'll miss the big game!

2. **Crossy Road–Style Streets**  
   Dash through chaotic traffic, dodging cars and obstacles in a fast-paced city sequence.

3. **On the Field**  
   Arrive at the stadium and avoid defenders in a high-energy sprint to the end zone.
